# GARCH Algorithm Testing

This repository is dedicated to testing and implementing the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) algorithm.

## About the GARCH Algorithm

The GARCH model is a statistical model used in econometrics and financial analysis to model and forecast volatility in financial time series.

## Project Goals

- Implement the GARCH(p, q) model.
- Test the algorithm with various financial datasets.
- Compare the performance of the GARCH model with other volatility models.

## Getting Started

[Provide instructions here on how to set up the project, if needed. For example, a list of dependencies or a brief guide on how to run the code.]
